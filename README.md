Phd-python
==========

This repo contains the majority of the (dirty) code that I wrote while working on my PhD. Please note that the code might not be very well documented. In fact, think of it as of a programming logbook than anything else.

If you are looking for some context, my up-to-date PhD thesis is available here: [kubkon/Thesis](https://github.com/kubkon/Thesis).
